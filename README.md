# reddit-search-saved-posts
A script to help redditors to perform search operations in their saved posts or comments

This is my first side project.

Prerequisites for this script

-  ### Create Reddit Script app 
    1. go to reddit -> preferences -> apps
    2. select "create another app" option
    3. fill Name, description, about-URI and redirect-URI (as of your choice)
    4. select **"Script"** Option **(this is important)**
    5. click on "create app"

-  ### Intializing the Variables
    1. after creating the script application, copy the secret & client_id key from reddit.
    2. paste these accordingly `CLIENT_ID` & `SECRET_KEY` of the script
    3. enter your username & password in `data` (since we'll need authorization from reddit)

  
### Using the app

run the python file or `redditSeachInSaved()` in notebook.

> note : you'll need to run this app each time you want to search in your saved history. I am new & am learning.
